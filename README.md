### Hi there  ðŸ‘‹

## Who are we?
The Research Society MIT is the official student research body of Manipal that works on an array of research projects, covering a broad span of fields, from artificial intelligence and robotics to nanotechnology and immunology.

## What we do?
We aim to facilitate the development of a research community that can work on projects, both interdisciplinary and otherwise. 

We also look to bridge the gap between our students and alumni from universities all across the globe, many of whom have an illustrious research background themselves. Along with this, we have several students who have published research and bagged foreign internships at premier institutes.

RSM actively strives to foster a holistic spirit of research and encourages students to pursue research in the hopes of making a meaningful contribution. To this end, several of our events, such as the paper discussion sessions, breakout discussions and alumni webinars, are open to everyone. Additionally, we also provide guidance to students of the institute, regardless of their prior research background and affiliation to the organization.
